    <p>
        Hi, I'm Dhiren Mahajan - a cloud engineer who loves translating business goals into resilient AWS solutions.
        Nimbus Nexus is my narrative-driven EC2 project where I demonstrate how thoughtful infrastructure, secure coding,
        and observability come together.

    <p>
        Deploy this Flask app on an EC2 instance behind Apache or Nginx with Gunicorn,
        wire the health endpoint into your monitors, and scale horizontally using user data scripts for automation.
        It's the same approach I take in production to guarantee reliable rollouts.
